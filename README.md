# Map-Printers-PS
A learning expierance with PowerShell

This project is primarily a effort to expand my own knowledge in working with PowerShell.
As the main goal for the project I would like to be able to automate the maping of printers to my users.
Since my network uses Active Directory I'll attempt to simply map all the printers in my OU with all my users in my OU.
I should probably discover and enumerate the printers on the network first.
